# TFOD--BeginnerLevel-Project
 A beginner-level Tensorflow Object Detection Project using tf v1.14.<br>
 <b>Credit</b> : The codes(with some local changes) are from the original repo : https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/v1.13.0<br>
 The image annotation tool 'LabelImg can be obtained from its original source : https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg<br><br>
 The model architecture used for this project is "faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco".<br>
 The model was trained locally on "i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz" + 8GB DDR3 RAM using tensorflow V1.14. For the next GitHub commit, the model will be trained on Colab for a longer duration(preferably on a GPU) to attain better performace.<br>
 The steps followed to train the model has been mentioned in the 'Read Me (Steps)' file in order to revise the steps or recreate the similar folder structure on future projects.
